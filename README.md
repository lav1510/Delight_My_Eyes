Ever wondered what Movie/TV Show should you watch tonight? I certanly did.

The aplication is used to **generate a random Movie/TV Show trailer**.
For logged in users the trailer can be added o a favourites list which can be seen later on.

For the admin, after logging in, he can add a new trailer in the database.

Delight My Eyes is a college project. It started the loggin/registration part with a fork from : https://github.com/IsAmitprajapati/Login-Register---MERN-Stack-MongoDB-express-React-js-Nodejs---2022.
